# Iris Flower Classification

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with 4 features each:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

Each algorithm is implemented and tested in separate Jupyter notebook files.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open any of the Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) to explore the code and results.
